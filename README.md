# Current Goals

## Software

### Python

-   [ ] make python script read in the logictec camera footage
-   [ ] process logitech camera footage using a computer vision algorithm
-   [ ] import an inverse kenimatics solver and solve the ik using robotic arm's constraints

### ESP32

-   [ ] set up gpio for ESP modules to properly communicate with transcievers
-   [ ] set up gpio for ESP modules to properly pulse width modulate (PWM) their designated servos

### STM32

-   [ ] set up STM to read a serial communication from the laptop, parse the data, and send over CAN bus to dedicated ESP ECUs

## Hardware

### Soldering

-   [ ] solder CAN transcievers
-   [ ] solder TOF sensors

### 3D Printing

-   [ ] 3D print plastic sheet to mount ESP modules and CAN trancievers
-   [ ] 3D print claw gripper/camera mount/TOF mount and mount to the robotic arm

### Connecting

-   [ ] mount ESP modules to board
-   [ ] connect items to power circuit via 6V 10A barrel jack adapter
